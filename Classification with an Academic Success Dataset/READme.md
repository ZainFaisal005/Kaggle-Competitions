# **Overview**
Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** The goal of this competition is to predict academic risk of students in higher education.

## **Evaluation**
Submissions are evaluated using the **accuracy score**.

## **Submission File**
For each id row in the test set, you must predict the class value of the Target, which is a categorical academic risk assessment. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,Target

76518,Graduate

76519,Graduate

76520,Graduate

etc.


## **Timeline**

**Start Date** - June 1, 2024

**Entry Deadline** - Same as the Final Submission Deadline

**Team Merger Deadline** - Same as the Final Submission Deadline

**Final Submission Deadline** - June 30, 2024


All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

## **About the Tabular Playground Series**

The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

## **Synthetically-Generated Datasets**
Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

## **Prizes**
**1st Place** - Choice of Kaggle merchandise

**2nd Place** - Choice of Kaggle merchandise

**3rd Place** - Choice of Kaggle merchandise


Please note: In order to encourage more participation from beginners, Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series. If a person has previously won, we'll skip to the next team.
